# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement authentication system
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create user authentication flow with Google sign-in and session management
# Details:
Implement authentication using Clerk with Google OAuth provider. Create sign-up and login pages with appropriate UI components. Set up user session management and protected routes. Design and implement the database schema for user accounts including fields for credits, subscription status, and render history. Ensure authentication state is properly maintained across the application. Follow security best practices from OWASP and SOC2 compliance standards.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, and logout flows. Verify session persistence and protected route access. Test with both valid and invalid credentials. Ensure Google OAuth integration works correctly. Validate security measures against OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities.

# Subtasks:
## 2.1. Integrate Clerk Authentication [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Clerk SDK and configure project settings
### Details:
Register ComicMotion application with Clerk, install SDK, configure environment variables, and implement basic authentication components.

## 2.2. Configure Google OAuth Provider [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Google OAuth flow through Clerk
### Details:
Register application with Google Cloud Platform, obtain OAuth credentials, configure Clerk to use Google as a social sign-in provider, and test the authentication flow.

## 2.3. Ensure Clerk JWT/Session Management is correctly implemented via middleware [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure Clerk JWT/Session Management is correctly implemented via middleware
### Details:
Set up secure JWT configuration with appropriate expiration times, implement refresh token logic, and ensure sessions are properly maintained across the application.

## 2.4. Create Authentication UI Components [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build sign-up, sign-in, and account management UI
### Details:
Develop responsive UI components for user registration, login, password reset, and account management screens that integrate with Clerk's authentication flow. Dedicated sign-in page (/sign-in) and sign-up page (/sign-up) have been implemented using Clerk's built-in UI components, complementing the previously created /account page.

## 2.41. Finalize Authentication UI Components [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Complete remaining UI elements for authentication flow
### Details:
Finalized UI components related to authentication using Clerk's built-in components (<SignIn />, <SignUp />, <UserProfile />), which handle password reset functionality, email verification screens (including email code verification during sign-in), and UI for handling authentication errors or edge cases. Further customization can be implemented iteratively if needed.

## 2.5. Implement Role-Based Access Control [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up user roles and claims for authorization
### Details:
Define user roles (e.g., free user, premium user, admin), implement claims-based authorization, and configure permission checks throughout the application.

## 2.6. Design User Database Schema [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create database schema for user account information
### Details:
Design and implement database tables/collections for storing user-specific data including credits, subscription status, and render history, ensuring proper relations with Clerk's user identifiers.

## 2.7. Implement Protected Routes [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create middleware for route protection based on authentication status
### Details:
Set up Next.js middleware to protect routes based on authentication status and user roles, redirecting unauthorized access attempts appropriately.

## 2.8. Apply Security Best Practices [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement security measures according to OWASP and SOC2 standards
### Details:
Apply security headers, CSRF protection, rate limiting, and other security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities. Document security implementations for SOC2 compliance.

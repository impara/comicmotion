# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement authentication system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create user authentication flow with Google sign-in and session management
# Details:
Implement authentication using Clerk with Google OAuth provider. Create sign-up and login pages with appropriate UI components. Set up user session management and protected routes. Design and implement the database schema for user accounts including fields for credits, subscription status, and render history. Ensure authentication state is properly maintained across the application. Follow security best practices from OWASP and SOC2 compliance standards.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, and logout flows. Verify session persistence and protected route access. Test with both valid and invalid credentials. Ensure Google OAuth integration works correctly. Validate security measures against OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities.

### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement security measures according to OWASP and SOC2 standards
### Details:
Apply security headers, CSRF protection, rate limiting, and other security measures to protect against common vulnerabilities. Document security implementations for SOC2 compliance.

## 2.9. Comprehensive Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create test suite for authentication flows
### Details:
Develop unit and integration tests for all authentication flows, including happy paths and edge cases. Test security measures against OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities.

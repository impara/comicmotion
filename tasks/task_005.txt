### Details:
Develop state management logic to track the selected theme. Ensure the selection is properly stored and can be retrieved for subsequent steps in the workflow. Implement proper validation and default theme handling.

## 5.6. Integrate theme selection with render pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect theme selection component with the rendering system
### Details:
Integrate the theme selection interface with the render pipeline so that the selected theme properly influences the generated comic. Ensure theme data is correctly passed to subsequent generation steps. Test the end-to-end flow from selection to rendering.

## 5.7. Implement responsive behavior for theme selection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure theme selection UI works across different screen sizes
### Details:
Adapt the theme selection interface for various screen sizes and devices. Implement responsive layout adjustments, touch-friendly interactions for mobile, and ensure accessibility standards are met across all viewport sizes.

# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement progress tracking system
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 4, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a real-time progress tracking system with ETA for the generation process
# Details:
Implement a WebSocket-based progress tracking system that provides real-time updates on the generation process. Create a progress UI with skeleton loader animations. Calculate and display estimated time remaining based on current step and typical processing times. Implement error state handling and recovery options. Ensure the progress UI follows the card-based step design (Progress: 1 ▶ 2 ▶ 3) specified in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Test real-time progress updates through the entire generation pipeline. Verify WebSocket connections are established and maintained. Test ETA calculations for accuracy. Verify proper display of progress states and error conditions. Test recovery options when errors occur.

# Subtasks:
## 8.1. Design and implement real-time progress UI component [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a responsive UI component that shows the current generation step, progress percentage, and estimated time remaining
### Details:
Follow the card-based step design from the PRD (Progress: 1 ▶ 2 ▶ 3). Implement state transitions and animations between steps. Include visual indicators for completed, current, and pending steps. CURRENT STATUS: Basic page structure created at /progress/[jobId]. Reads jobId, displays step indicators, and shows simulated status updates. Uses icons for different states. Progress page UI now driven by real data polled from backend status API, replacing mock simulation. Implemented Temporal query handler in workflow and updated status API to provide specific stage (scene vs. animation). Frontend polling now uses this stage for more accurate progress bar display.

## 8.2. Implement WebSocket client integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up WebSocket client to connect to backend and receive real-time progress updates
### Details:
Create WebSocket connection manager with auto-reconnect capability. Implement message parsing for progress updates. Handle connection errors gracefully with user feedback.

## 8.3. Develop backend job status polling mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a reliable system to poll job status from various generation services
### Details:
Create a service that polls the status of generation jobs from different microservices. Implement adaptive polling intervals based on expected processing times. Ensure the system can handle multiple concurrent jobs.

## 8.4. Create ETA calculation algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop an algorithm to estimate remaining time for the generation process
### Details:
Collect and analyze historical processing time data for each generation step. Implement a weighted average algorithm that factors in current system load. Update ETA dynamically as processing progresses.

## 8.5. Implement skeleton loader animations [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create placeholder animations that display while content is being generated
### Details:
Design skeleton loaders that match the final content layout. Implement smooth transitions between loading and content states. Ensure loaders are accessible and respect user preferences for reduced motion. CURRENT STATUS: Basic placeholder div implemented instead of Shadcn Skeleton due to missing dependency. Shows a 'Visual preview loading...' message.

## 8.6. Implement error state handling and recovery options [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create robust error handling with user-friendly recovery options
### Details:
Implement error state UI with clear error messages. Provide retry options for failed steps. Create a system to resume generation from the last successful step when possible. CURRENT STATUS: Basic error display implemented based on simulated errors. Retry button placeholder added. Progress page now handles basic error states (workflow failed, API errors) based on polled backend status.

## 8.7. Create WebSocket server endpoint for progress updates [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement server-side WebSocket endpoint to broadcast progress updates to clients
### Details:
Set up WebSocket server with authentication and connection management. Implement message queue for progress updates. Ensure scalability for multiple concurrent clients.

## 8.8. Integrate with Temporal query handler for detailed progress tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Leverage the implemented Temporal query handler to enhance progress tracking granularity
### Details:
Build upon the Temporal query handler implementation to further enhance progress tracking. Ensure the WebSocket implementation can utilize the stage-specific information (scene vs. animation) provided by the status API. Implement additional UI refinements to take advantage of the more granular progress information.

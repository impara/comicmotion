# Task ID: 11
# Title: Develop render history and deletion functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to track render history and handle deletion requests
# Details:
Implement a render history system that tracks all user generations. Create a UI to display render history with thumbnails and metadata. Implement deletion functionality to comply with 'Right to Erasure' requirements. Ensure deletion removes all associated files from storage and database records. Add confirmation dialogs for deletion actions.

# Test Strategy:
Test render history display with various user scenarios. Verify deletion functionality properly removes all associated data. Test with multiple renders and confirm accurate tracking. Verify deletion confirmation works as expected. Test edge cases like deletion during in-progress renders.

# Subtasks:
## 11.1. Design and implement render history UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a user interface for displaying render history with thumbnails and metadata
### Details:
Design and implement a UI component that displays a list of user renders with thumbnails, creation date, status, and other relevant metadata. Include pagination for users with many renders. Ensure the UI is responsive and follows the application's design system.

## 11.2. Implement backend storage for render history [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create database schema and API endpoints for storing and retrieving render history
### Details:
Design database schema to store render history with appropriate fields (userId, renderId, creationDate, status, metadata, etc.). Implement API endpoints for retrieving user render history with filtering and pagination capabilities. Ensure proper indexing for efficient queries.

## 11.3. Implement soft deletion functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the ability to mark renders as deleted without removing data
### Details:
Implement soft deletion by adding a 'deleted' flag to the render records. Update UI to hide soft-deleted renders from normal view. Add API endpoints to mark renders as deleted. Ensure soft-deleted renders are excluded from normal queries but can be recovered if needed.

## 11.4. Implement hard deletion functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the ability to permanently delete render data
### Details:
Implement hard deletion that completely removes render data from the database and associated files from storage. Create background jobs to handle deletion of files from cloud storage. Ensure all references to deleted renders are removed from related tables.

## 11.5. Implement 'Right to Erasure' compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure the system can fully comply with GDPR and similar regulations
### Details:
Create a process to handle user requests for complete data deletion. Implement functionality to identify and remove all user-related render data. Create audit logs for deletion requests. Document the deletion process for compliance purposes.

## 11.6. Add confirmation dialogs for deletion actions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement user-friendly confirmation for deletion operations
### Details:
Design and implement confirmation dialogs for both soft and hard deletion actions. Include clear messaging about the consequences of each action. For hard deletion, implement a more stringent confirmation process (e.g., requiring typing 'delete' to confirm).

## 11.7. Implement deletion handling for in-progress renders [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Handle edge cases where deletion is requested for renders still in progress
### Details:
Create logic to handle deletion requests for renders that are still processing. Implement graceful cancellation of in-progress renders when deletion is requested. Ensure resources are properly cleaned up when cancelling renders.

# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement observability and error handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive logging, monitoring, and error handling systems
# Details:
Implement structured logging across all services. Set up error tracking with appropriate categorization. Create monitoring dashboards for system performance and model latency. Implement graceful degradation for API failures. Set up alerts for critical errors and performance issues. Add detailed error messages and recovery options for users. Implement the failure modal with friendly copy and 'Try again' functionality as specified in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Test logging with various scenarios including errors and edge cases. Verify error tracking captures all relevant information. Test monitoring dashboards with simulated load. Confirm alerts trigger appropriately. Test user-facing error messages and recovery options for clarity and functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 14.1. Implement structured logging framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a consistent structured logging framework across all services
### Details:
Implement structured JSON logging with standardized fields like timestamp, service name, severity level, request ID, and message. Ensure consistent log formats across frontend, backend, and AI processing services. Include contextual information in logs to aid debugging.

## 14.2. Set up Sentry for error tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate Sentry for capturing and categorizing errors across the system
### Details:
Implement Sentry SDK in all services. Configure error grouping and tagging. Set up source maps for frontend errors. Create custom error boundaries in React components. Implement context enrichment to include user information and request details with errors.

## 14.3. Create Grafana monitoring dashboards [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop comprehensive monitoring dashboards for system performance
### Details:
Set up Grafana dashboards for key metrics including API response times, model inference latency, queue depths, and system resource utilization. Create custom panels for business metrics like user conversion rates and feature usage. Configure dashboard sharing and access controls.

## 14.4. Implement graceful degradation patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create fallback mechanisms for API and service failures
### Details:
Implement circuit breaker patterns for external API calls. Create fallback content strategies when AI generation fails. Build retry mechanisms with exponential backoff. Ensure partial data can be displayed when some components fail.

## 14.5. Configure alerting system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up alerts for critical errors and performance degradation
### Details:
Configure alerts in Grafana for performance thresholds. Set up Sentry alert rules for error spikes. Implement PagerDuty integration for critical issues. Create escalation policies and on-call rotations. Set up Slack notifications for various alert severities.

## 14.6. Develop user-facing error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create friendly error messages and recovery options for users
### Details:
Design and implement the failure modal with friendly copy and 'Try again' functionality as specified in the PRD. Create contextual error messages for different failure scenarios. Implement automatic retry for transient errors. Add helpful suggestions for user actions that might resolve issues.

## 14.7. Set up distributed tracing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement request tracing across services
### Details:
Set up distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry. Propagate trace context across service boundaries. Configure sampling rates to balance observability and performance. Integrate tracing with Grafana for visualization.

## 14.8. Create health check endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement health and readiness checks for all services
### Details:
Create standardized health check endpoints for all services. Implement deep health checks that verify database connections and dependencies. Set up Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes. Configure monitoring for health check status.

# Task ID: 15
# Title: Perform integration testing and optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct end-to-end testing and optimize performance across the entire pipeline
# Details:
Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the entire generation pipeline according to the Technical Solution Design (TSD) for ComicMotion. Optimize API performance to meet the p95 < 300ms requirement (excluding model latency). Implement caching strategies for commonly used themes to reduce costs. Test and optimize for concurrent renders (target: 1000 concurrent). Ensure all accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA) are met. Prepare the system for horizontal scaling of queue workers. Verify all security requirements including encryption at rest and signed URLs.

# Test Strategy:
Perform end-to-end testing with various user scenarios. Conduct load testing to verify performance under high concurrency. Use lighthouse and similar tools to verify accessibility compliance. Conduct security testing including penetration testing following OWASP guidelines. Measure and verify API performance metrics. Test the complete user journey from signup to download.

# Subtasks:
## 15.1. Develop end-to-end integration test suite [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive test suite covering all major user flows
### Details:
Develop automated test scripts that verify the complete user journey from registration to comic generation and download. Include tests for all supported themes, animation styles, and export formats. Verify proper error handling and edge cases.

## 15.2. Perform performance and load testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify system performance under expected and peak loads
### Details:
Set up performance testing environment with JMeter or k6. Test API endpoints to ensure p95 < 300ms. Verify queue processing performance under load. Test concurrent rendering with simulated traffic (target: 1000 concurrent users). Identify and address bottlenecks.

## 15.3. Conduct security testing following OWASP guidelines [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform comprehensive security testing using industry-standard tools
### Details:
Run OWASP ZAP scans against all API endpoints. Verify secure authentication and authorization. Test for common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, injection attacks). Verify proper implementation of signed URLs. Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

## 15.4. Implement caching strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize performance and reduce costs through strategic caching
### Details:
Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed themes and templates. Set up CDN caching for static assets. Configure appropriate cache invalidation strategies. Measure and document performance improvements and cost savings.

## 15.5. Optimize critical paths in rendering pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks in the generation pipeline
### Details:
Profile the rendering pipeline to identify bottlenecks. Optimize image processing operations. Implement parallel processing where applicable. Reduce unnecessary API calls between services.

## 15.6. Verify accessibility compliance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure the application meets WCAG 2.1 AA requirements
### Details:
Run automated accessibility tests using Lighthouse and axe. Perform manual testing with screen readers. Verify proper keyboard navigation. Document compliance and any remediation steps.

## 15.7. Prepare for horizontal scaling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure the system can scale horizontally to handle increased load
### Details:
Verify queue workers can scale horizontally without conflicts. Test auto-scaling configurations. Ensure database connections are properly managed during scaling events. Document scaling procedures and limitations.

## 15.8. Create performance monitoring dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring for production environment
### Details:
Configure Prometheus and Grafana for real-time performance monitoring. Set up alerts for critical thresholds. Create dashboards for API performance, queue metrics, and error rates. Document baseline performance metrics.
